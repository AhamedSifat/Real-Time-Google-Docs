## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x
- npm or Yarn

> **Important:** This project uses React 19 (Release Candidate) with Next.js 15. Due to React 19 being in RC phase, some dependencies haven't been updated yet to officially support it. If you're using npm, you'll need to install dependencies with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. This has been tested and works correctly.
>
> Users of bun can install normally without any special flags.
